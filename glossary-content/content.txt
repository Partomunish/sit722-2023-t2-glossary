DevOps
An approach to software engineering that aims to align software developers and operations staff. In this way, there is nonconflicting tasking and a seamless transition of project artifacts via interoperable processes and tools.

It involves cross-functional and self-organized teams working collaboratively to achieve the desired outcomes.

Microservice
A self-contained unit with its own specific functionality. It communicates with other microservices in the application through well-defined APIs.

Kubernetes
An open-source container orchestration platform used for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust system for coordinating and scheduling containers across a cluster of nodes. This allows applications to run consistently and reliably in various environments.

Docker
An open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications within containers. In this context, containers refer to lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that package the application's code and all its dependencies.

Container
A lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software. A container typically includes code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

Cluster
A group of interconnected computers or servers that work together to provide a higher level of performance, availability, and reliability. In DevOps, clusters are often used to manage and distribute containerized applications, as in the case of Kerbernetes clusters.

Virtual Machine
A software-based emulation of a physical computer. It allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine, enabling greater resource utilization and isolation.
